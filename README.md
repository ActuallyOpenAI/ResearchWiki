Doing good research can be very hard. If you're new to the field it can be difficult to know even what are good projects/problems to work on. We think the reason that there isn't an open research community isn't a lack of interest or ability. Having guidance on literature, how to run good experiments and someone to bounce ideas off of can make a huge difference to the likelihood of success.

We're a community of technically literate researchers and engineers working together on open research problems with some guidance from academics in the relevant areas.


In this wiki we're documenting guidance on:

* Our research ideas and interests
* Strategies for reading the literature efficiently and taking notes
* Advice on running good experiments
* Advice on good communication and writing.

### Contributing
We're starting as a small community of 7 researchers initially but hope to open to a wider audience in the future.

If you'd like to help and are an experienced researcher. Please feel free to submit a pull request to add advice on doing good research to this wiki.
